## 🌍 Use Cases

### 1. Observe Seasonal Sunrise/Sunset Changes

**Goal**: See how sunrise/sunset bearings change throughout the year

**Steps**:
1. Click your location on the map
2. Click "Summer Solstice" (June 21)
3. Press **Down Arrow** repeatedly or click **◂** to go back day by day
4. Watch the sunrise/sunset lines move on the compass rose
5. Continue until Winter Solstice (December 21)

**What You'll See**:
- Northern Hemisphere: Sunrise/sunset bearings shift from northeast/northwest (summer) to southeast/southwest (winter)
- The shift happens gradually, about 0.5-1° per day
- Maximum range: ~60° shift from summer to winter at mid-latitudes

### 2. Track Equinox Approach

**Goal**: Observe convergence to due east/west at equinoxes

**Steps**:
1. Click any location
2. Set date to March 10 (10 days before Spring Equinox)
3. Press **Right Arrow** 10 times (or **▶** to skip weeks)
4. Watch bearings converge to ~90° (East) and ~270° (West)

**What You'll See**:
- Sunrise/sunset lines gradually rotate toward cardinal points
- At equinox (March 20): nearly perfect east/west alignment
- Works at all latitudes!

### 3. Compare Weekly Changes

**Goal**: See how much sun position changes in a week

**Steps**:
1. Select location
2. Pick any date
3. Note sunrise/sunset bearings in legend
4. Press **Shift + Right** (next week)
5. Compare new bearings

**What You'll See**:
- Near solstices: minimal change (0-2°)
- Near equinoxes: maximum change (5-7°)
- Demonstrates varying rate of seasonal change

### 4. Year-Long Animation

**Goal**: Create a mental model of annual sun movement

**Steps**:
1. Click location
2. Set to January 1
3. Hold **Up Arrow** or rapidly click **▸**
4. Watch compass rose animate through the year
5. Observe the "breathing" pattern of sunrise/sunset bearings

**What You'll See**:
- Bearings expand outward from summer solstice
- Bearings contract inward toward winter solstice
- Smooth, periodic motion

## 🎯 Educational Applications

### Geography Class

**Latitude Comparison**:
1. Set date to Summer Solstice
2. Click equator (0°) - note bearings
3. Press **Up Arrow** to advance days
4. Click Arctic Circle (66°N) - note different bearings
5. Compare rate of change at different latitudes

**Lesson**: Higher latitudes = more extreme seasonal variation

### Astronomy Class

**Understanding Solstices**:
1. Navigate to June 21 (Summer Solstice)
2. Note maximum sun path range
3. Press **Down Arrow** daily
4. Watch bearings narrow toward equinox
5. Continue to December 21 (Winter Solstice)
6. Observe minimum sun path range

**Lesson**: Earth's axial tilt causes seasonal sun position changes

### Photography Planning

**Golden Hour Planning**:
1. Click your shooting location
2. Set date to planned shoot date
3. Use **◂**/**▸** to fine-tune the exact day
4. Check sunrise/sunset bearings
5. Plan camera placement based on sun direction

**Lesson**: Sun rises/sets at different bearings throughout year

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Speed Navigation

**Fast Forward Through Year**:
- Use **▶▶** (Next Month) to jump forward quickly
- Example: January → February → March → etc.

**Fast Rewind Through Year**:
- Use **◀◀** (Previous Month) to jump backward
- Example: December → November → October → etc.

**Week-by-Week Analysis**:
- Use **Shift + →** to advance by weeks
- Good for observing gradual changes
- Example: See how bearings shift each week in spring

### Keyboard Efficiency

**Right Hand on Arrow Keys**:
- Up/Down for daily navigation
- Left/Right for monthly navigation
- Add Shift for weekly navigation
- Very fast once you get the rhythm!

**Example Workflow**:
1. Press **T** to jump to today
2. Press **Left** 3 times to go back 3 months
3. Press **Up** 5 times to go forward 5 days
4. Press **Shift + Right** 2 times to skip 2 weeks

### Combining with Time Animation

**Best Practice**:
1. Navigate to desired date using arrows
2. Click **Play** to animate through the day
3. Watch sun marker move around compass
4. Press **Up Arrow** to advance to next day
5. Repeat to see multi-day progression

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Date Increment Logic

**Day Navigation**:
```javascript
function changeDate(amount, unit) {
    const newDate = new Date(currentDate);
    if (unit === 'day') {
        newDate.setDate(newDate.getDate() + amount);
    }
    currentDate = newDate;
    datePicker.setDate(currentDate);
    updateAll();
}
```

**Month Navigation**:
```javascript
if (unit === 'month') {
    newDate.setMonth(newDate.getMonth() + amount);
}
```

### Smart Month Handling

JavaScript's Date object automatically handles:
- Month boundaries (Jan 31 + 1 day = Feb 1)
- Year boundaries (Dec 31 + 1 day = Jan 1 next year)
- Leap years (Feb 28 + 1 day = Feb 29 in leap years)
- Month length variations (March 31 + 1 month = April 30, not May 1)

### Keyboard Event Prevention

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    // Ignore if user is typing in an input field
    if (e.target.tagName === 'INPUT') return;

    // Prevent default browser scrolling with arrow keys
    e.preventDefault();

    // Handle navigation
});
```

This ensures:
- Arrow keys don't scroll the page
- Keyboard shortcuts don't interfere with date picker input
- Smooth, predictable navigation

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

### Button Hover Effects
```css
.nav-btn:hover {
    background: #667eea;
    border-color: #764ba2;
    transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

Buttons "lift" on hover to indicate interactivity.

### Button Press Effects
```css
.nav-btn:active {
    transform: translateY(0);
}
```

Buttons "press down" when clicked for tactile feedback.

### Date Picker Sync
- Flatpickr input updates automatically
- Shows current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Maintains calendar state

## 🐛 Edge Cases Handled

### Month-End Transitions
- **Jan 31 → Feb 31**: Auto-corrects to Feb 28 (or 29)
- **March 31 + 1 month**: Becomes April 30 (not May 1)
- **Handles all month lengths**: 28, 29, 30, 31 days

### Year Boundaries
- **Dec 31 + 1 day**: Correctly becomes Jan 1 (next year)
- **Jan 1 - 1 day**: Correctly becomes Dec 31 (previous year)
- **Leap years**: Automatically detected

### Time Preservation
- When changing dates, the **time of day is preserved**
- Example: If it's 3:45 PM on June 15, pressing **Up Arrow** gives June 16 at 3:45 PM
- Useful for comparing same time across different dates

## 📈 Seasonal Change Rates

### Maximum Change (Equinoxes)
- **Daily change**: ~5-7° in sunrise/sunset bearings
- **Weekly change**: ~35-49°
- **Monthly change**: ~50-60° (can span entire range)

### Minimum Change (Solstices)
- **Daily change**: ~0-2° in sunrise/sunset bearings
- **Weekly change**: ~0-14°
- **Monthly change**: ~20-30°

### Why This Matters
Understanding these rates helps you:
- **Plan ahead**: Know how much sun position will change
- **Choose dates**: Pick when sun will be in desired position
- **Predict patterns**: Anticipate seasonal shifts
